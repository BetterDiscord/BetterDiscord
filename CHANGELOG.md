## 1.0.0

### Added
- **Everything** is entirely rewritten, for better or worse.
- **Emotes and Custom CSS** can be completely turned off for those not interested. It saves on memory too by not loading those components.
- **Floating editors** for both custom css and plugins/themes are now available.
- **Monaco** is now used as the main CSS editor, in place of Ace.
- **Settings panels** are completely new and sleek. They are also highly extensible for potential future features :eyes:
- **Translations** are now integrated starting with only a couple languages, but feel free to contribute your own!
- **Public servers** got a new makeover thanks to some design help from Tropical and Gibbu!
We added settings to hide the **Gif Picker** and the **Nitro Gift** buttons in the textarea.

### Changed
- **Patcher API** was added to `BdApi` under `BdApi.Patcher`. The old `BdApi.monkeyPatch` was patched to use the Patcher as well. This allows plugins and patches to play nice with one another.
- **jQuery** was removed from dependencies.
- **General performance** improvements throughout the app, from startup to emotes to addons.
- **Exporting** by plugins is now highly encouraged over trying to match your meta name and class name.
- **Plugins and Themes** pages have more options for sorting, views and more. The entire panel got a facelift!
- **Blankslates** have been added all over for that added UX.
- **Several unused UI features** have been removed for a more performant and usable experience.
- **Debugger Hotkey** is now a built-in feature!

### Fixed
- **Minimal mode** has been redesigned from the ground up and now works as intended.
- **Emote menus** are fixed and now use React Patching to properly integrate into the new Emoji Picker. (Thanks Strencher#1044!)

BandagedBD (Bandaged BetterDiscord) is a fork of the original [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp) by Jiiks. This has a number of improvements over the original which is currently undergoing a full rewrite. In the interim, the current version has been unmaintained hence this fork existing. I will continue to maintain this fork until BDv2 comes out. I am helping to develop BDv2 as well so as release gets closer this fork will become less and less active.

# FAQ

### What is this?

This is a client modification for Discord. You can read more about it in the [original repo](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp).

### Where can I get plugins and themes?

In our suport servers we have channels with lists of official plugins and themes. Please note we do not have an official listing on a website and are **not affiliated with any of those websites**.

### Support Servers?

Yup we have two of them [this one](https://discord.gg/0Tmfo5ZbORCRqbAd) and [this one](https://discord.gg/2HScm8j)
